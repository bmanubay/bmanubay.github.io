## `Python` Packages

### General Use Science Packages
- [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/): the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
- [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/): a Python plotting library which produces publication quality figures 
- [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/): an open source library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language
- [`scipy`](https://www.scipy.org/): a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering
- [`theano`](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/): a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently

### MCMC, Parameterization, etc.
- [`PyMC3`](https://docs.pymc.io/): a package for Bayesian statistical modeling and probabilistic machine learning which focuses on advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo and variational fitting algorithms
- [`emcee`](https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): implementation of Goodman & Weareâ€™s Affine Invariant Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Ensemble sampler
- [`arviz`](https://arviz-devs.github.io/arviz/index.html): a Python package for exploratory analysis of Bayesian models. Includes functions for posterior analysis, sample diagnostics, model checking, and comparison

### Machine Learning
- [`sklearn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): Python's most popular machine learning library
- [`yellowbrick`](https://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/index.html): Visual analysis and diagnostic tools to facilitate machine learning model selection
- [`tensorflow`](https://www.tensorflow.org/): an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications. It has a stable, user-friendly Python API (among many others).
