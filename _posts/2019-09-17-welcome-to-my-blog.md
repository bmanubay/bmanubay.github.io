Hello readers and welcome to **Bryce's Random Walk** (if you don't appreciate the pun, you might after I explain it later :) ).
This is going to be my personal platform for talking about data science, software and maybe some more personal insights and rants.
In order to kick things off. let's start with a little about myself. My name is Bryce Manubay and, by degree, I'm a chemical engineer.
I have both my B.S. and M.S. in chemical engineering. By practice, however, I'm a computational chemical physicist, data scientist
and statistician. I'm also an amateur software developer (emphasis on amateur, but I try). 

I moved to my current home of Boulder, CO in August 2015 in order to start my PhD in chemical engineering at CU. While at CU, I worked
with Prof. Michael Shirts and the Open Force Field Initiative on re-designing many dimensional model parameterization for classical
mechanics and molecular dynamics chemical simulations. In a future post, I'll speak more in detail about the initiative and 
plug/demonstrate some of nice software they've released. The main goal of the initiative is to make model parameterization in 
this field accesible and transparent to more researchers and re-design the single optima approach as a Bayesian inference problem where we 
end up with a family of equally likely models given the data we train with. My role in the group was as one of the primary researchers 
for accelerating sampling in high-dimensional space (through a combination of clever surrogate modeling and gradient-enhancement) and 
curating high-quality thermophysical data in cooperation with the NIST Thermodynamics Research Center. 
For a number of reasons, chief among them that I felt overworked and was desperately unhappy, I decided to "master out" in September 2018. 
I had fallen out of love with being a scientist and I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, only that I needed a break from science. 
Since then, I have been employed part-time as a professional tutor for math, science and engineering courses in a diverse array of 
disciplines. I also worked for ~6 months (Nov 2018 - Apr 2019) on contract as a professional research assistant in a polymer science lab 
at CU (which resulted in a few secondary authorships for my efforts). It was because of this contract work that I was able to realize that 
I still wanted to solve science and engineering problems and, in particular, wanted to go back to statistics, software and data science
work. Since then I've been looking for work as a data scientist in the Denver Metro area and continuing to work part-time as a tutor.

Now that the groundwork is set and you all know me a little better, **why am I doing this**? In addtion to providing tutorials for people
learning new data science techniques, this blog/website will serve as a platform for me to advertise my skill set and projects to 
companies hiring in my area! I also intend to use this as motivation to learn, practice and display new techniques to add to my 
repertoire. I've had this idea for a while now, but just haven't made the effort to act on it. I finally got sick of waiting and decided 
this was beneficial and proactive enough to pursue, so here we are. Stay tuned for posts on data science, software and the like. I'm 
uncertain of a schedule yet, but I'll work on finding an optima in the space of post frequency and quality. Thanks for reading!
