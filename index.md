Howdy folks! Welcome to **Bryce's Random Walk**! This is my website and will be a platform for me to talk about data science, 
advertise my projects and advertise myself as a scientist. Please feel free to look around, learn some data science techniques, 
new software tools and hopefully something about me.

## What's here?
- [About](https://bmanubay.github.io/about/): A short blurb about the author, yours truly!
- [Blog](https://bmanubay.github.io/blog/): Here's the good stuff! These blog posts will teach you about new data science techniques, software tools and emerging science topics.
- [Useful Tools](https://bmanubay.github.io/useful_tools/): Here I'll be compiling a list of useful software packages and tools that I use in my blog posts.
